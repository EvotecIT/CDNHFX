This code is here to support HtmlForgeX project. Files hosted here are served via:

- jsDelivr (versioned, GitHub tag-based)
- GitHub Pages (latest, auto-published on push)
- Any custom CDN that mirrors this repository (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)

This repository exists so HtmlForgeX can use CDN capabilities for files that are big but are not hosted elsewhere or for files that are modified from originals.
